# Brewery Finder

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Info

Search for a Brewery by name or search for breweries by City.

Select an individual brewery to show additional details by clicking on it after the search results appear.

Add your favorite breweries to the favorites list by clicking "Add to Favorites" button on the individual brewery page.

Favorited breweries will now show up in the Favorites List.

Each individual favorite can also be clicked on which will display additional info.

Future plans include the ability to log, rate, and make comments about beers you have had from different breweries. This will be located on each individual favorite page.
